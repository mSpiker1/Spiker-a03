# Spiker-ao3 redo

## Fixes for this resubmission

###### General:
>-less static methods, more object classes
>
>-all exercises now have a first commit of psuedocode, then code is added in subsequent commits

###### Exercise 24:
>Gradle test task now works for exercise 24

###### Exercise 28:
>re-did psuedocode, did not add a unit test because it's all just a main method. It literally
only contains one variable, one output statement, and one input statement. If I were to
restructure the code in order to make this exercise more testable, it would only make this
extremely simple program 10x more complicated than it needs to be.
